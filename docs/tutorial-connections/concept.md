# Concept

POIs (Points of Interest) are organized within regions, which are managed by regional partners. Each region comprises a specific set of POIs. 

### Condensed Information
Sublin, a marketing platform, prioritizes the promotion of sustainable and accessible destinations. It does not aim to be an all-encompassing journey planner. Instead, Sublin focuses on showcasing the most pertinent connections between cities and travel destinations that align with the specific characteristics of the promoted destination.

For example, if a user intends to travel to a hotel, Sublin will exclusively present connections that align with the hotel's check-in period. This ensures that users are provided with relevant and convenient connection options tailored to their specific stay requirements.

### Connection with MaaS (Mobility-as-a-Service) Providers
Sublin promotes suitable connections for travel destinations as a marketing platform. While we do not offer routing, navigation, and ticketing services directly, our platform facilitates deep linking with relevant providers to offer comprehensive connection options. This allows users to seamlessly access routing, navigation, and ticketing services provided by our partners through our platform.
