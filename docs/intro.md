# Getting Started

**[Sublin](https://www.sublin.me)** is a marketing platform for sustainable connections to POIs. The Sublin API allows service providers to add connections and releated services to the plattform.

### What you'll need

In order to connect with the Sublin API you need to have a valid API-key which grants you access to specific **[Sublin REST endpoints](https://api.sublin.cloud/docs)**.

## Add and Manage Connections

Sustainable connection between train stations and POIs and between POIs is at the heart of Sublin. For that Sublin relies on 
mobility operators, travel agencies, Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) providers and providers of routing services to provide 
connection data to the platform.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
