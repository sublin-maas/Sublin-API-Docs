# Getting Started

**[Sublin](https://www.sublin.me)** is a marketing platform that enables sustainable connections to Points of Interest (POIs). The Sublin API allows service providers to add and manage connections and related services on the platform.

### What you'll need

To establish a connection with the Sublin API, a valid API key is required. This key grants you access to specific Sublin REST **[Sublin REST endpoints](https://api.sublin.cloud/docs)**.

## Add and Manage Connections

Sustainable connection between train stations and POIs and between POIs is at the heart of Sublin. For that Sublin relies on 
mobility operators, travel agencies, Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) providers and providers of routing services to provide 
connection data to the platform.
